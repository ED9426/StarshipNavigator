Files Written by Me:
--------------------
- Vertex.java : Allows for vertex objects to be created with attributes of name, type, 
	      and a list of connections and a list of the weights of the connections. This class also implements
	       the Vertex interface.
- VertexDataReader.java : Takes an input of type Reader and creates a list of Vertex objects
- DataWranglerTests.java : This method tests the implementation of the VertexDataReader class and specifically 
			    the readDataSet method. It has three tests to check regular input, empty connections, and check weights. 
          It also uses JUnit to check for correctness. 
- VertexInterface.java : implemented by the Vertex class

- VertexDataReader.java : implemented by the VertexDataReader class
-Starship Delivery Times.csv: The file where the data is being read which holds all the information 
about the places, types of places, and its connections
